	<h1>History</h1>
	<p>We started this venture with SUNRAYS brand name and earned trust
		of our trainees and clients. We expanded to multiple cities of India
		and successfully completed 8 years. SUNRAYS was our registered
		trademark but was restricting us to expand to other cities of India.
		SUNRAYS name was conflicting the interest of Oracle America due to its
		SUN RAY brand. We strongly fought for SUNRAYS in Mumbai High Court but
		decided to leave it and maintain the same trust and growth path with
		other brand name. We changed our name to Rays Technologies. It will
		provide training on Open Source Technologies and Java under SunilOS
		brand name.</p>
